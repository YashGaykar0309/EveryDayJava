//Chef has invented 1-minute Instant Noodles. As the name suggests, each packet takes exactly 1 minute to cook.
//        Chef's restaurant has X stoves and only 1 packet can be cooked in a single pan.
//        How many customers can Chef serve in Y minutes if each customer orders exactly 1 packet of noodles?
