//Chef is planning to buy a new car for his birthday. After a long search, he is left with 2 choices:
//
//        Car 1: Runs on diesel with a fuel economy of x1 km/l
//        Car 2: Runs on petrol with a fuel economy of x2 km/l
//        Chef also knows that
//
//        the current price of diesel is y1 rupees per litre
//        the current price of petrol is y2 rupees per litre
//        Assuming that both cars cost the same and that the price of fuel remains constant, which car will minimize Chef's expenses?
//
//        Print your answer as a single integer in the following format
//
//        If it is better to choose Car 1, print âˆ’1
//        If both the cars will result in the same expenses, print 0
//        If it is better to choose Car 2, print  1
